IF I HAD MORE TIME:

Unit tests for all functions
Functional tests for all routes
Proper Mocks for all tests

Provide proper error handling via curried functions, to seperate error handling from concerns

Handle inappropriate paramters, such as bad locations, and bad times

Include JSHINT Paramaters at the top (Just moved to sublime three and linters are not setup :( )
 
Models!

Cleaned up package.json

Made the code more durable!
